# In order to make the Twitter Stream and Twython function you will require a developer twitter account,
# You will also require the twitter keys (consumer key, consumer secret key. etc), you can get this from the developer 
# home page by creating a new app and copy and pasting the keys into a python document(named TpAUTH) with the variable names as
# costmerK,
# costmerSK,
# apiK,
# apiSK,
# SK refers to the secret key K refers to the normal key. DO NOT SHARE THESE KEYS. generate new keys if you accidentally leak these keys.
# additionally you will need to create a output.txt file(just open a notepad doc and name it output)
